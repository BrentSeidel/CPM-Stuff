# CPM-Stuff
A collection of sample code and utilities relating to CP/M.  CP/M programming
languages and software are available from a variety of sources.  This mostly
contains some example programs in various languages I've run.

## Environment
I am using CP/M 2.2 running on a simulated Z-80 from the [Sim-CPU](https://github.com/BrentSeidel/Sim-CPU)
simulator.

## Other Resources
This will be a list of pointers to other sources of CP/M software, utilities,
and documentation.
* [Retrocomputing Archive](http://www.retroarchive.org) - A large source of CP/M (and other software)
* [HUMONGOUS CP/M Software Archives](http://cpmarchives.classiccmp.org_ - Another large archive
* [CP/M Sources](http://www.cpm.z80.de/source.html) - Assembler source for CP/M 2.2 can be found here
* [ASxxxx](https://github.com/0cjs/ASxxxx) - A large collection of assemblers and linker that run on the host system.  I used
this to build the CP/M binary that then gets written to the disk image.
