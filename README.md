# CPM-Stuff
A collection of sample code and utilities relating to CP/M.  CP/M programming
languages and software are available from a variety of sources.  This mostly
contains some example programs in various languages I've run.

## Environment
I am using CP/M 2.2 running on a simulated Z-80 from the [Sim-CPU](https://github.com/BrentSeidel/Sim-CPU)
simulator.

## Other Resources
This will be a list of pointers to other sources of CP/M software, utilities,
and documentation.
